Fill in a diagonal line in every grid square so that there are no loops in the grid, and so that every numbered point has that many lines meeting at it.

Left-click in a square to mark it with a `\`; right-click to mark it with a `/`. Keep clicking in a square to cycle it between `\`, `/` and empty.
