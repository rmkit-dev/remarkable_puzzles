Dominosa

Tile the rectangle with dominoes (1&times;2 rectangles) so that every possible domino appears exactly once (that is, every possible pair of numbers, including doubles).

Click between two adjacent numbers to place or remove a domino. Right-click to place a line between numbers if you think a domino definitely cannot go there. Dominoes light up red if two identical ones appear on the grid.
