Connect all the squares together into a sequence, so that every square's arrow points towards the square that follows it (though the next square can be any distance away in that direction).

Drag from a square to the square that should follow it, or long-press drag from a square to the square that should precede it.

Drag a square off the grid to break all links to it. Long-press drag a square off the grid to break all links to it and everything else in its connected chain.
